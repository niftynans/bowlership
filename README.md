# bowlership
Team sports are all about player synergies; deciding when to let your partner take the shot in Tennis doubles or anticipating the next pass in Football. This is why often the best single’s champions are not necessarily the best doubles’ champions in Tennis, and the team with more star players does not necessarily win the Football match. In this paper, we investigate bowler pairs. We introduce and precisely define a bowling partnership. Bowlers bowl in pairs from opposite ends of the field alternately. It is often the case that a pair of bowlers bowl several consecutive overs alternately. We define such pairs of bowlers a bowling pair. Are some bowling pairs more effective than others? Are they effective in terms of saving runs or taking wickets?
