# Bowlership: Examining the Existence of Bowler Synergies in Cricket

Player synergies are a salient feature of team sports. In the team game of cricket,
player synergies may be reflected in batting partnerships. Batting partnerships
have been analysed extensively. 

In this paper, we introduce and precisely define
bowling partnerships. We explain their importance, and analyse ball-by-ball
data from three formats of the game: 2,034 one-day international matches, 634
Test matches and 1,432 Twenty-20 international matches, in order to find such
bowling partnerships (“bowlerships”). 

We find that bowlerships exist. Further, we construct bowlership networks based on these pairwise synergies. We assert
that these bowlership networks can be analysed for team selection before a
match, and making bowling changes during the match. We present Algorithm
bowler-select that selects a team based on bowlerships.
